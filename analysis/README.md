Scripts and workflows to reproduce the analysis in the manuscript

- [`annotate`](annotate): Projecting HPRC haplotype annotations into the pangenome using `vg annotate`.
- [`encode`](encode): Making coverage track for ATAC-seq datasets from ENCODE.
- [`readsorting`](readsorting): Sorting short sequencing reads mapped to the pangenome.
- [`variants`](variants): Projecting known SNPs/indels (GWAS catalog, eQTLs, ...) into the pangenome.
- [`visualization`](visualization): Visualizing some example (*soon*).

Below are general commands used by those scripts and workflows to prepare, sort, compress, index, and query annotations in GAF.
